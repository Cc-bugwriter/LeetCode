# Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an integer arrayÂ nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.

- Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

- Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 2000
- -106 <= nums[i] <= 106

### Idea
Use the 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence basis idea, to calculate the length of  Increasing Subsequence.
Use another container lens to count the number of Increasing Subsequence corresponding with the length.
- if the length increases, initial the number with 1
- if the length is equal with other sub-array, add the number of other sub-array to current
- the initial condition of dp (length of increasing subsequence) is same as 300.
- the initial condition of lens is 1, which means the mindest number of increasing subsequence (equal to 1, at least 1 subsequence -> it self)

    int findNumberOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int num = 1, len = 0;
        vector<int> dp = nums;
        vector<int> lens = nums;
        dp.assign(dp.size(), 1);
        lens.assign(lens.size(), 1);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < dp.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    if (dp[i] < dp[j] + 1) {
                        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                        lens[i] = lens[j];
                    } else if (dp[i] == dp[j] + 1) {
                        lens[i] += lens[j];
                    }
                }
            }
            num = max(dp[i], num);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < dp.size(); ++i) {
            if (num == dp[i]) len += lens[i];
        }
        return len;
    }
