# 152. Maximum Product Subarray
Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

It is guaranteed that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.


## Method 1: Dynamic Programming v1.0
### Idea
- use two array to catch the max/min value of product
- due to the negative value, the min value can be the maximum product
- the transition state bases on three state: 
	- - least max * current element
	- - least min * current element
	- - current element (throw the previous product)
- using dynamic programming to update the arrays
- the final maximum product was chosen in catched product (num) or the element of max array
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        int num = nums[0];
        vector<int> dp_max = nums, dp_min = nums;

        for (int i = 1; i< nums.size(); ++i) {
            dp_max[i] = max(nums[i], max(dp_max[i - 1] * nums[i], dp_min[i - 1] * nums[i]));
            dp_min[i] = min(nums[i], min(dp_max[i - 1] * nums[i], dp_min[i - 1] * nums[i]));
            num = max(num, dp_max[i]);
        }

        return num;
    }
};
```
