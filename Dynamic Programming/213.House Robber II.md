# 213. House Robber II
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## Method 1: Dynamic Programming
### Idea:
- split the problem in two conditions -> transform the circle problem into two simple house robber problem
	- without last element (with first element) -> dp_1
	- with last element (without first element) -> dp_2
- use two array to transverse all possible
- same idea with simple house robber problem
	- choose a candidate from two previous elements dp[i - 2] and dp[i - 3]
	- add the current income with the chosen candidate
	- compare the current income with previous maximal income
```
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int num = 0;
        
        if (nums.empty()) return num;
        if (nums.size() == 1) return nums[0];
        if (nums.size() == 2) return max(nums[0], nums[1]);

        vector<int> dp_1 = nums; 
        dp_1.pop_back();
        vector<int> dp_2 = nums;
        dp_2.erase(dp_2.begin());

        for (int i = 1; i < dp_1.size(); ++i) {
            if (i == 1) num = max(max(dp_1[0], dp_1[1]), max(dp_2[0], dp_2[1]));
            else if (i == 2) {
                dp_1[i] = max(dp_1[i - 2] + dp_1[i], dp_1[i - 1]);
                dp_2[i] = max(dp_2[i - 2] + dp_2[i], dp_2[i - 1]);
            } else {
                dp_1[i] = max(dp_1[i - 2], dp_1[i - 3]) + dp_1[i];
                dp_2[i] = max(dp_2[i - 2], dp_2[i - 3]) + dp_2[i];
            }
            num = max(num, max(dp_1[i], dp_1[i - 1]));
            num = max(num, max(dp_2[i], dp_2[i - 1]));
        }

        return num;
    }
};
```
