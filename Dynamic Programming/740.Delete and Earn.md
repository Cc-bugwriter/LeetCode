# 740. Delete and Earn
Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points.
6 total points are earned.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 104

## Method 1: Dynamic Programming
### Idea: contribute a counts array, convert the original problem to a typical Houser Robber problem
- sort the given array nums -> simplify the following operation
- contribute the counts array
- do the HR solver on counts array
```
class Solution{
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        // sort the given array
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // contribut a new array, which contains the appearance times of each element in nums
        int maxnum = nums[nums.size() - 1] + 1;
        vector<int> counts (maxnum, 0);
        // counts the appearance times
        for (int num : nums)  counts[num] ++;

        // typical houser robber algorithm
        int res = 0, curr = 0, prev = 0, tmp = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < maxnum; ++i) {
            tmp = max(prev + i * counts[i], curr);

            prev = curr;
            curr = tmp;

            res = max(res, curr);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
### Complexity Analysis:
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
